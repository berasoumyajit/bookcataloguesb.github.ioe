<td bgcolor=white><font face="Century" size=3><b><i>The Adventures of Tintin is a series of 24 Franco-Belgian comics created by Belgian cartoonist Georges Remi, who wrote under the pen name Hergé. The series was one of the most popular European comics of the 20th century. By 2007, a century after Hergé's birth in 1907, Tintin had been published in more than 70 languages with sales of more than 200 million copies, and had been adapted for radio, television, theatre and film.<br> The series has been admired for its clean, expressive drawings in Hergé's signature ("clear line") style. Its well-researched plots straddle the action-adventure and mystery genres and draw upon themes of politics, history, culture and technology, offset by moments of slapstick comedy.</i></b></font></td>
